          In 2010, I received a clear and direct call from God to dedicate my life fully to His service. From that

        <p data-aos="fade-right"> I was born into a Christian family. During my school days, I was deeply involved in church activities and
          had a strong faith in Jesus. I enjoyed the presence of God and was active in spiritual life throughout my
          childhood.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">
          However, after completing my 10th grade and entering +1 and +2, my life took a different turn. I fell into bad
          company and slowly drifted away from the Lord. I got involved in worldly pleasures and began living a sinful
          life. I neglected my relationship with God and disobeyed my parents, thinking I was living freely—but in
          reality, I was lost.
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-up">One painful incident became a turning point in my life. The very friends I trusted the most betrayed me. I
          felt completely broken and rejected. The guilt of turning away from God and hurting my parents consumed me. In
          despair, I came to a dark place and even attempted to end my life.
        </p>

        <p data-aos="zoom-in">
          But God, in His mercy, saved me.
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-right">In that moment of deep pain, the Lord spoke to me through His Word: “I found you in your mother’s womb, and I
          have chosen you for a purpose.” That verse shook me. It reminded me that my life was not an accident, and that
          God had a plan for me, even before I was born.
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-left">I fell into deep repentance, realizing how far I had strayed. I asked God for forgiveness and fully
          surrendered my life to Jesus Christ. That was the moment of true transformation.
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-up">In 2010, after much prayer and seeking, God gave me a vision to start a ministry called Rejoice, Laugh, and
          Live — with a mission to “Reach the Unreached.” Since then, I have been walking in His calling, dedicating my
          life to serve others and share the love and salvation of Jesus Christ.
        </p>

        <p data-aos="zoom-in">
          I am a living testimony of God's grace and purpose. No matter how far we may fall, His love can lift us,
          restore us, and use us for His glory.
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-up">All glory to Jesus!</p>
